# Paper analyser
The goal of this project is to enable quantitative analysis of 
academic papers. To achieve this, the project contains logic for

1. Parsing academic white papers into structured representation
1. Doing analysis on the structured representations

Paper analyser is maintained by Ada Logics, including (David Korczynski)[https://twitter.com/Davkorcz] and (Adam Korczynski)[https://twitter.com/AdamKorcz4]

## Dependency
Paper analyser relies on PDF file representations of academic papers.
As such, it is up to you to find these papers. 

For convenience we maintain a list of links to software analysis papers
focused on software security in our sister repository [here](https://github.com/AdaLogics/software-security-paper-list)
