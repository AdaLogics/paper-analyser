# Paper analyser
The goal of this project is to enable quantitative analysis of 
academic papers. To achieve this, the project contains logic for

1. Parsing academic white papers into structured representation
1. Doing analysis on the structured representations

Paper analyser is maintained by Ada Logics, including:

## Dependency
Paper analyser relies on PDF file representations of academic papers.
As such, it is up to you to find these papers. 

For convenience we maintain a list of links to software analysis papers
focused on software security in our sister repository [here](https://github.com/AdaLogics/software-security-paper-list)


## Contribute
We welcome contributions. 

We are particularly interested in features for:
1. Improved parsing of the PDF files to get better structured ouput out
1. More data analysis into the project


### Feature suggestions
If you would like to contribute but dont have a feature in mind, please see the list below for suggestions:

* Extraction of authors from papers
* Extractino of the actual text from the papers. This could be used for a lot of cool data analysis
